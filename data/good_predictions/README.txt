This folder contains the "good" qual predictions we got for
single-algorithm and multi-algorithm approaches. The files' names specify
the kind of algorithm and our percentage above water. For instance,
SVDPP_4.5.dta would mean that file contains ratings generated by SVD++ that
brought us 4.5% above water.  Combined/blended algorithms can be denoted
with extra underscores, or they can have names like BLEND1_6.0.dta.

If a label is used to specify results, a brief description of the
corresponding algorithm is given below:
