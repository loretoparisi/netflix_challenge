This folder contains the "good" qual and "probe" predictions we got for
single-algorithm and multi-algorithm approaches. The files' names specify
the kind of algorithm, the dataset that we trained on, and our percentage
above water. For instance, SVDPP_PROBE_4.5.dta would mean that file
contains ratings generated by SVD++ on the "probe" dataset that brought us
4.5% above water.  Combined/blended algorithms can be denoted with extra
underscores, or they can have names like BLEND1_QUAL_6.0.dta. The
correspondence between blend names and their contents should be included
below.

SVDPP_QUAL_6.193: This was generated on April 17 at 3:17 am. SVD++ was run
for 30 iterations with 200 factors. Training was carried out on the "base",
"hidden", and "valid" sets, and testing was done on the "qual" set. The
following constants were used:
    * Regularization:
        * SVDPP_LAM_B_I = 0.005
        * SVDPP_LAM_B_U = 0.030
        * SVDPP_LAM_Q_I = 0.006
        * SVDPP_LAM_P_U = 0.080
        * SVDPP_LAM_Y_J = 0.030
    * Learning rates:
        * SVDPP_GAMMA_B_I = 0.003
        * SVDPP_GAMMA_B_U = 0.012
        * SVDPP_GAMMA_Q_I = 0.011
        * SVDPP_GAMMA_P_U = 0.006
        * SVDPP_GAMMA_Y_J = 0.001
    * Learning rate decay (common to all rates):
        * SVDPP_GAMMA_MULT_PER_ITER = 0.9
