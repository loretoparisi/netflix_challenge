NOTE FROM LAKSH:
None of these predictions were generated by algorithms running on the
entire training set. So, feel free to get rid of the files in here later on
and replace them with more appropriate ones for quiz-blending purposes.


===========================================================================
INTRODUCTION
===========================================================================

This it the directory where predictions on "qual" will be stored, before
they are blended via quiz blending (see src/quiz_blend.py). It is assumed
that each of the training algorithms used were trained on all of the data,
i.e. base, hidden, valid, and probe.

Each of the files in this folder must follow this convention: their names
must end with "_QRMSE_<QUIZ RMSE>.dta", where <QUIZ RMSE> is the RMSE that
that specific predictor achieved on the quiz dataset. Typically, the name
will start off with a description of the algorithm and the general
parameters (e.g. epochs, number of factors) used. An example name is:
    
    TIMESVDPP_FAC_130_EPOCH_30_QRMSE_0.88515.dta

If additional details are required, they will be added below.

TIME-SVD++ (overfit)
---------------------

TIMESVDPP_FAC_110_EPOCH_80_QRMSE_0.87817: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.697 in
"good_predictions". This run did use userFacMatTime, and was slightly
overfitted (learning rate decay set to 0.90).


TIME-SVD++ (not overfit)
-------------------------

TIMESVDPP_FAC_110_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.87752: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.765 in
"good_predictions". This run did use userFacMatTime.

TIMESVDPP_FAC_60_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.87911: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.598 in
"good_predictions". This run did use userFacMatTIme.

TIMESVDPP_FAC_20_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.88668: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_6.803 in
"good_predictions". This run did use userFacMatTime.

TIMESVDPP_NO_UFMT_FAC_100_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.8796: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.547
in "good_predictions". This run did not use userFacMatTime.

TIMESVDPP_NO_UFMT_FAC_200_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.8789: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.620
in "good_predictions". This run did not use userFacMatTime.

TIMESVDPP_NO_UFMT_FAC_20_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.88863: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_6.598
in "good_predictions". This run did not use userFacMatTime.

TIMESVDPP_NO_UFMT_FAC_500_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.87834: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.679
in "good_predictions". This run did not use userFacMatTime.
