NOTE FROM LAKSH:
None of these predictions were generated by algorithms running on the
entire training set. So, feel free to get rid of the files in here later on
and replace them with more appropriate ones for quiz-blending purposes.


===========================================================================
INTRODUCTION
===========================================================================

This it the directory where predictions on "qual" will be stored, before
they are blended via quiz blending (see src/quiz_blend.py). It is assumed
that each of the training algorithms used were trained on all of the data,
i.e. base, hidden, valid, and probe.

Each of the files in this folder must follow this convention: their names
must end with "_QRMSE_<QUIZ RMSE>.dta", where <QUIZ RMSE> is the RMSE that
that specific predictor achieved on the quiz dataset. Typically, the name
will start off with a description of the algorithm and the general
parameters (e.g. epochs, number of factors) used. An example name is:
    
    TIMESVDPP_FAC_130_EPOCH_30_QRMSE_0.88515.dta

If additional details are required, they will be added below.

overfitted (learning rate decay set to 0.90).

TIMESVDPP_FAC_60_EPOCH_80_QRMSE_0.87924: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.585 in
"good_predictions". This run used userFacMatTime and was overfitted
(learning rate decay set to 0.915).

-------------------------

TIMESVDPP_FAC_345_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.87629: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.895 in
"good_predictions". This run did use userFacMatTime, and took up almost the
full 32 GB of RAM on Walker's computers (~300 MB left over).

TIMESVDPP_FAC_110_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.87752: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.765 in

"good_predictions". This run did use userFacMatTime.

TIMESVDPP_NO_UFMT_FAC_100_EPOCH_40_QRMSE_0.8796: See TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.547

"good_predictions" for more information.

SVDPP_FAC_1000_EPOCH_80_QRMSE_0.88479: See SVDPP_QUAL_7.001 in
