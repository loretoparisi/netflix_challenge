NOTE FROM LAKSH:
None of these predictions were generated by algorithms running on the
entire training set. So, feel free to get rid of the files in here later on
and replace them with more appropriate ones for quiz-blending purposes.


===========================================================================
INTRODUCTION
===========================================================================

This it the directory where predictions on "qual" will be stored, before
they are blended via quiz blending (see src/quiz_blend.py). It is assumed
that each of the training algorithms used were trained on all of the data,
i.e. base, hidden, valid, and probe.

Each of the files in this folder must follow this convention: their names
must end with "_QRMSE_<QUIZ RMSE>.dta", where <QUIZ RMSE> is the RMSE that
that specific predictor achieved on the quiz dataset. Typically, the name
will start off with a description of the algorithm and the general
parameters (e.g. epochs, number of factors) used. An example name is:
    
    TIMESVDPP_FAC_130_EPOCH_30_QRMSE_0.88515.dta

If additional details are required, they will be added below.

TIME-SVD++
-----------

TIMESVDPP_FAC_110_EPOCH_25_QRMSE_0.87768.dta - this is an extension to
SVD++^(3), with frequency-dependent biases and extra bin-wise item factors.
This was generated using the parameters specified in "good_predictions" for
TIMESVDPP_QUAL_7.749.dta. Note that this predictor has been trained on
probe as well.

TIMESVDPP_FAC_130_EPOCH_30_QRMSE_0.88515.dta - this is SVD++^(3), generated
using the parameters specified in "good_predictions" for
TIMESVDPP_QUAL_6.963.dta. Note that this has not been trained on probe.

TIMESVDPP_FAC_500_EPOCH_30_QRMSE_0.88572.dta - this is SVD++^(1), generated
using the parameters specified in "good_predictions" for
TIMESVDPP_QUAL_6.904.dta. Note that this has not been trained on probe.


SVD++
------

SVDPP_FAC_200_EPOCH_25_QRMSE_0.89204.dta - this is SVD++, generated using
the parameters specified in good_predictions.dta for SVDPP_QUAL_6.239.dta.
Note that this has not been trained on probe.


RBM (which type?)

Residual kNN

X.dta - this is kNN trained on the residuals of
