This folder contains cached internal data for SVDPP objects. This is
intended to avoid constantly re-training.

Our mapping from internal variables to files (in this folder) is:
    * bUser -> b_user.mat
    * bItem -> b_item.mat
    * userFacMat -> user_fac.mat
    * itemFacMat -> item_fac.mat
    * yMat -> y.mat
